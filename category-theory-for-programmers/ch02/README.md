# 2 Types and Functions

## 2.1 Who needs types?

People who want correct programs (read: everyone).

## 2.2 Types are about composability

-   Strong type system - better verification for composability
-   Not a silver bullet though - no amount of strong typing can tell you that you should have multiplied by 3 instead of 2.

## 2.3 What are types?

Intuition: types are *sets of values*, e.g.

- `Bool` type - either `True` or `False`, an example of a **finite** type
- `Integer` type - 0, 1, 2, ..., an example of an **infinite** type (at least in Haskell)

## 2.4 Why do we need a mathematical model?

## 2.5 Pure and dirty functions
